# Basic Usage

## Command Line Usage
`mutate.sh` is the main script that can be used to generate a mutant for an input knowledge graph. Run `mutate.sh -h` to see the options how to run the program. The user needs to specify the input knowledge graph and a file name for the output graph. Optionally, a mask that the output needs to conform to and the number of mutations that are applied can be provided. Note, that the script first builds the project, which only need to be done once after the source code is modified.
